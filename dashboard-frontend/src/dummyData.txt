First thing we should know is that this project is related to the food delivery app, which works in desktop as well as mobile, so we should make every component very responsive accordingly.

Please make the Navbar buttons responsive
In the settings, we can add update userInfo like name, email, mobileNumber
We can create user card component to show the User Info
Add any dummy notifications in the notifications list
Add dummy mail from any dummy user in the mail list
Currently notifications and mails same for all logged in users
Use orders info from database by the filter of user

Make the search functionality working to search for orders using order number and give the order number suggestions as the user start typing the order number

Here Home icon redirects to the dashboard page
Analytics icon redirects to the orders page
Tasks icon redirects to the custom taskboard page where the user can add the list of tasks and mark them complete
Wallet icon redirects to the Wallet page where use can see the amout or orders devivered by using orderDeliveredOnDate filter

Bag button redirects to the page to add orders or update the order status
We should add orders data in the dataBase
Order data includes the information: userId, userName, customerName, customerImage, orderNumber, orderReceiveDate, orderDeliveredOnDate, deliveryStatus:[PENDING, CANCELLED, DELIVERED], actualAmount, soldAtAmount, dishName, instructions
When customerImage is not provided, use the customerName initial as the image in the ordersList view in the dashboard and Analytics page
Add the icons from bootstrap for Home, Analytics, Tasks, Wallet and Bag
Try to use the same icons as per shown in the image

Develop the user feature to login or signup
Add logout button in Sidebar at the bottom
Also add the login or signup page and save all the user info in the database
While signup ask for: userName, email, mobileNumber, password, image and signup Button
Login page should contain userName, password and logIn Button
User can login by using any of the following combinations:
[userName, password] or
[email, password] or
[mobileNumber, password] or
[name, password]

We should improve the comments section
In the comments section, the ratings should be responsive 
And should be shown comment message under the start ratings
